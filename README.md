# Hidden correlations in Steam Game reviews
 Steam is an online platform that many people use to purchase video games. 
 Users can leave reviews on games so that other users can make informed purchases.
 I have 3 questions that I will use the metrics of said reviews to answer

## Questions
1) Do newer games tend to have more positive reviews?
2) Are certain operating systems more likely to have games that are rated higher?
3) Is price correlated to a higher or lower rating?

## Data set
The data set is "Game Recommendations on Steam", uploaded to Kaggle by Anton Kozyriev.<br> 
This is an extremely up-to-date data set, with the last update being 20 days ago. <br>

## Methodology
Similar to the group project I will be using Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to interact with and visualize the data.
